# Odd Numbers

## Problem

- output all odd numbers from 1 to 99
- include 1 and 99
- put each number on a separate line

## Examples

```ruby
1
3
5
7
9
...
99
```

## Data Structures

- Integers
- Possibly a range (1..99)

## Algorithm

- create a range from 1 to 99 inclusive (1..99)
- iterate through the range
- for each number
  - if it is odd, output it (puts)
  - otherwise, do nothing and go onto the next
